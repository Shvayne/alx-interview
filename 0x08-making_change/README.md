# 0x08. Making Change

This project involves solving the "Making Change" problem, which determines the minimum number of coins required to meet a given amount. It leverages dynamic programming to efficiently compute the solution.
---

## Description

The task is to implement a function, `makeChange`, that calculates the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given total using a list of available coin denominations. If it is not possible to meet the total using the given coins, the function should return `-1`.
