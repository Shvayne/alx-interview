# N Queens Solver

This Python script solves the N Queens puzzle, which is the challenge of placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. It uses a backtracking algorithm to find and print all possible solutions for a given `N`.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Usage

To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 0-nqueens.py N
```
Replace N with the size of the chessboard and the number of queens to place.

## Constraints
1. `N` must be an integer greater than or equal to 4.
2. If `N` is not provided, or if it is not an integer, or if it is less than 4, the program will output an error message and exit.
